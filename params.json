{"name":"Robo.Op","tagline":"Industrial Robots. Open for Creativity.","body":"### Welcome to _Robo.Op_, an Open Hardware project for hacking Industrial Robots.\r\n_Robo.Op_ provides hardware and software resources for quickly prototyping custom [end-effectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_end_effector), so you can do [strange things](https://github.com/madelinegannon/R0BOT/wiki/1.-Project-Overview#related-works) with industrial robots.\r\n<br/>\r\nIndustrial robots (IR) are expensive, closed, proprietary machines.  As a consequence, these incredible machines tend to be limited to industrial applications: where it is safer, cheaper, faster, or more efficient to use robots instead of with humans.  High costs also extend to peripheral devices of industrial robots: external axes, mounting plates, cables, connectors are all add-on costs that further reduce the economic accessibility of these systems. However, a shift has begun. Artists, architects and designers are beginning to gain access to these machines –– and they are exploring strange new modes of integrating industrial robotics into creative workflows.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n_Robo.Op_ is a hardware & software toolkit for exploring the fringes of industrial robotics.\r\nDocumentation can be found in two sections:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Code for live communication between your Robot & Processing, Arduino, OSC can be found [here](https://github.com/peopleplusrobots/robo-op).</li>\r\n<li>Resources for building your own *Universal Adaptor Shield* can be found [here](https://github.com/peopleplusrobots/robo-op/wiki).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n_Robo.Op_ is an ongoing-project.  We are currently developing:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Additional project examples for: mark-making, light drawing, projection mapping, human-robot interaction.</li>\r\n<li>Android templates for remotely controlling Industrial Robots with mobile devices.</li>\r\n<li>ROS node for more advanced motion planning.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWe are looking for collaborators to port robot code from ABB to other brands, such as KUKA, Stabuli, FANUC, etc.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n_Robo.Op_ was started by Madeline Gannon (@madelinegannon), Zack Jacobson-Weaver (@zackjw), and Mauricio Contreras (@maurothesandman).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
