##Robo.Op
###*Industrial Robots. Open for Creativity.*


_Robo.Op_ is an open hardware / open software platform for hacking industrial robots (IRs). 
_Robo.Op_ makes it cheaper and easier to customize your IR for creative use, so you can _explore the fringes of industrial robotics_.
<br/><br/>
This version of _Robo.Op_ is changed for the ABB YuMi. The code is written in C#. Also a very simple Unity example is provided.
<br/>
The repository contains the code needed for the ABB YuMi written in RAPID and the C# code for unity or Visual Studio.
